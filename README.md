# TTS Mod

The scripts folder contains all of the existing scripts for the mod. In order to contribute to this project, see information on the [TTS Plugin for Atom](https://api.tabletopsimulator.com/atom/). Once you have that setup, pull down this project to a local repo. As you make updates to the scripts (when using the Atom plugin, you'll be working with files located in a temp directory), make sure to copy those over to the local repo. Put up a PR and I'll check the updates! :)

If you need to create *new* scripts, or desire to make new objects within the mod, make sure to also include an updated version of the mod itself (the JSON file located at `/Mod/2482128330.json`).


## Desired Updates

These are some of the updates I intend to make, in no particular order. Please feel free to submit Issues for feature requests! (using the Issues tab near the top of the page)

* Ability to playtest upcoming ALeP content (I lied, this is probably my top priority lol)
* Streamline quest setup - provide better automation around quest setups (similar to OCTGN or the Arkham mod)
* An updated deckbuilder - rather than having to input text, the deckbuilder can be modified to take a ringsDB deck id (private or published) and build a deck from that. There is potential to also integrate this with the test ringsDB site (used for creating decks with unreleased, ALeP playtest cards).
* **CTRL+N** - OCTGN users know what I mean ;) - The ability to automate the happenings of the refresh and resource phases as a singular unit (or even separately when needed).
* Ability to swap in a defined threat area for a player - can add niceties like a "discard" button to send enemies directly to the discard pile
* Potential for reorganization of player cards for easier in-game deckbuilding (for those that would do such a thing XD)
* ??? Please let me know what you want to see!
