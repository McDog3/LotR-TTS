## Dev Notes
Rather than checking a copy of *each* object with a script, I instead have generalized to the form of the "Bag Memory" script each box has.
* The saga boxes that get laid out - `Quest-Selection-Saga-Script.ttslua`
* The mini boxes that get laid out in the "Quest Selection" area - `Quest-Selection-Script.ttslua`
* The mini boxes that get laid out in the "Mode Selection" area - `Difficulty-Selection-____.ttslua` (a script for each of Easy / Standard / Nightmare)
